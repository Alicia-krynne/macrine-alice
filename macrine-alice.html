<p>Hi! welcome to my landing page i am Alice</p>
<p>My friends call me Alice while my family calls me Adhiambo.</p>

<h2> <strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h2> 
<p>    A more boring person has never existed. its  true. i have no proper talents other than making bad dad jokes</p>
<p>    I am  the first in a family of 5- <em>i think</em>. 
       I was born and raised in nairobi but i went to High School in Eldoret
       My hobbies are sleeping-<em>when posible</em>and eating whenever food is presented.</p>
<P class="Bold"> My current intrests are:</P>
<ul>
    <li> <span id="first">Web Development</span>
        <p>  I have always been interested in  doing webrelated studies. making a website of my favorite things is on the top of my list
        making  websites and  softwares that are going to be needed in the future.</p>  
    </li>
    <li> <span id="second">Crime Series</span>
        <p> I happen to really  like watching  crime documentatries and my favorite channels happen to be reel crime docuseries on youtube.
